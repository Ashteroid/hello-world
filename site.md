    <h1>Web Design by Ashteroid</h1>
    <h2>A way to learn</h2>
    <p>Hi there. Here's where I practice my web design skills. I'm a newbie, so there's not much to see here yet!</p>
    <table>
        <th colspan="3"><h3>I'm working on...</h3></th>
        <tr>
          <td>Aesthetics</td>
          <td>Readability</td>
          <td>Function</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>I do graphic design by day, so once I grasp the HTML and CSS basics, I hope to be well on my way to making some snazzy websites for work and play!</p>
