      <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
      <p>Hi there. This is where I practice my web design skills... I'm a newbie, so there's not much to see here yet! But hopefully, I will create a spectacle soon enough.</p>
      <table class="table">
        <th colspan="3"><h3>I'm working on...</h3></th>
        <tr>
          <td>Aesthetics</td>
          <td>Readability</td>
          <td>Function</td>
        </tr>
      </table><br>
      <p>I do graphic design by day, so once I grasp the HTML and CSS basics, I hope to be well on my way to making some snazzy websites for work and play!</p>
